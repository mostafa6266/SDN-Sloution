It is a network solution that monitors the status of the network and has some of the services of the AAA server, which is searching for the location of a specific MAC address within the network and clarifying what is present on any of the network switches and its location in the switch itself and ignoring if it is present on a port from the state of the trunk. Successfully finding the Mac displays some of the things that it can do, such as changing the villain, blocking it from the core or from the switch itself, or verifying that the MAC addresses it has remain on the same port. When the Mac is blocked, it registers it in the database as blocked, so that You searched again and it tells you that you have blocked this machine and explains the time in detail that you blocked it, as well as the reason, and offers a suggestion to unblock it, whether it is on the core or the switch.

You can also create a bot on Telegram and enter it into the program, as I have prepared the function. You can add the bot token and your chat ID, and the program will send you a message if a switch is disconnected from the network, as it checks all switches every three minutes. There is also a full page for Access Point with some nice features

There are more features than what I wrote. You can talk to me or try it yourself if you want to know them all

(An important note: You must add the organizationâ€™s buildings before adding the switches. It is best to divide the switches into more than one building within the system so that you can benefit from all of its power.)
